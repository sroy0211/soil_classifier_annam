🌱 Soil Classification Challenge - 2025 Hackathon by Annam.ai at IIT Ropar 🌍

Welcome to my submission for the Soil Image Classification Challenge 2025!

This competition focuses on applying deep learning to automatically classify soil types based on image data. The goal is to distinguish between:

🏞️ Alluvial Soil

🌑 Black Soil

🧱 Clay Soil

🟥 Red Soil

The task blends computer vision and sustainability — with real-world implications for agriculture, environmental monitoring, and climate resilience. 🚜🌾

Our approach leverages EfficientNet-B0, a lightweight yet powerful convolutional neural network architecture that provides a great balance between speed and accuracy.

⚙️ Setup & Run Instructions

🚨 Before starting, make sure you have the dataset from the hackathon downloaded.

1. Clone the repository.

2. Download the dataset from the competition platform and place it inside the data/ directory.

3. Install the required dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the notebook:
   
   Open the Jupyter notebook in the notebooks/ folder

5. Update file paths in the notebook wherever necessary (e.g., when loading images or CSV files) to match your local data/ directory.

6. Execute the notebook cells step-by-step to preprocess data, train the model, and generate predictions for submission.
