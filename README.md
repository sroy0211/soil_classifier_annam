🌱 Soil Classification Challenge - 2025 Hackathon by Annam.ai at IIT Ropar 🌍

Welcome to my submission for the Soil Image Classification Challenge 2025!
This competition focuses on applying deep learning to automatically classify soil types based on image data. The goal is to distinguish between:

🏞️ Alluvial Soil
🌑 Black Soil
🧱 Clay Soil
🟥 Red Soil

The task blends computer vision and sustainability — with real-world implications for agriculture, environmental monitoring, and climate resilience. 🚜🌾

Our approach leverages EfficientNet-B0, a lightweight yet powerful convolutional neural network architecture that provides a great balance between speed and accuracy.
